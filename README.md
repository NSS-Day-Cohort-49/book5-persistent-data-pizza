TODO now:
 
1. Write a function for fetching the data
  1. Make an HTTP request to the db to get sizes data
  1. Turn the returned data into a JS array of objects
  1. Change the application state to the newly fetched sizes data
1. Call that function (fetchSizes) in main.js <-- When?
1. Create the html wording that iterates over that data ( prolly using map )
1. Display the sizes data as HTML in the browser as a form

Timeline from the moment the app loads
1. Fetch the data from the database 
2. Update application state with the returned db state
3. Render application state as HTML


TODO later:    
Talk about how to select and SAVE order data ( one crust, one size, 1+ topping(s))
