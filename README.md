TODO now for Orders:
 
1. Write functions for fetching the data
  1. Make an HTTP request to the db to get orders data
  1. Make an HTTP request to the db to get orders_toppings data
  1. Turn the returned data into a JS array of objects
  1. Change the application state to the newly fetched orders and orders_toppings data
1. Call those function (fetchOrders and fetchOrdersToppings) in main.js <-- When?
1. Create the html wording that iterates over that data ( prolly using map )
1. Display the orders data as HTML in the browser as a list

Timeline from the moment the app loads
